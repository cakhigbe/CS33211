Considers a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. 
Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. 
Suppose at time t0 following snapshot of the system has been taken:

Implements the Banker’s algorithm to answer the following question：
+ Is the system in a safe state? 
+ If Yes, then what is the safe sequence?
